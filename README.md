# README

here are some really simple examples of perl's XML::Simple.

## example_1

the most basic example.

## example_2

a slightly more complex example. still really simple.

## example_3

a slightly even more complex example. still fairly simple. this one has arrays within an item (which is part of an array).

## example_4

same as example_3 but we loop through the array of "filename"s.
